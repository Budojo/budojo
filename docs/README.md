# Budojo — Documentation

This folder is the living reference for Budojo's domain model, API contract, and product specs. If you (or a future collaborator, or a Claude agent) need context on how the system is shaped today, start here — not from the code.

## Who reads what

| Audience | What to read |
|---|---|
| New contributor onboarding | `entities/` then `api/v1.yaml` |
| Front-end / API consumer | `api/v1.yaml` (import into Postman, Insomnia, or Swagger UI) |
| On-call / deployer | `infra/production-deployment.md` for the live runbook + env / DNS / TLS topology |
| Claude Code agent | Everything — the PR will fail review if docs are stale (see `CLAUDE.md` "Documentation discipline") |
| Product planning | `specs/` |
| UI / design contributor | `design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and `design/preview/` |

## Update discipline

This folder is source-of-truth. Any PR that changes:

- A migration (new table, new column, new index, altered constraint)
- A backed enum (new case)
- An API route (new endpoint, new query param, changed payload or response)
- A business rule that's expressed in code but not in the schema (e.g. academy ownership scoping, soft-delete semantics)

…must update the relevant file in `docs/` **in the same PR**. Claude's CLAUDE.md has a rule (`#16`) to enforce this; the CI Spectral job catches malformed OpenAPI.

If a change is purely internal (refactor, rename of a private symbol, formatting) and does not alter the public contract — no doc update needed.

## OpenAPI convention

- Single-file monolith (`api/v1.yaml`) for now. When the file grows past ~1500 lines, split into `paths/` and `components/schemas/`.
- OpenAPI 3.0.3 (not 3.1) — broader tooling support (Swagger UI, Redocly, Postman, Insomnia, Stoplight).
- Every schema referenced inline must have a matching entry under `components/schemas/`. Spectral `lint` in CI blocks ghost references.
