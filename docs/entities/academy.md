# Entity — `Academy`

## Purpose

An `Academy` is the **tenant boundary** of Budojo. Every domain object in the app (athletes today, documents / attendance / promotions in future milestones) belongs to exactly one academy. The academy is also the unit that scopes authorization: when a user makes an authenticated request, all reads and writes are implicitly filtered to their academy.

Today the model is 1-to-1 with `User` — one owner per academy, one academy per owner. This is the `academies.user_id` unique constraint. Multi-owner or staff roles are future work.

## Schema — `academies`

| Column | Type | Constraints | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | bigint unsigned | PK, auto-increment | |
| `user_id` | bigint unsigned | FK `users.id`, cascade on delete, **unique** | Owner of the academy. Unique ensures 1-to-1 with User |
| `name` | string(255) | not null | Display name ("Gracie Barra Lisboa") |
| `slug` | string(255) | not null, **unique** | URL-friendly identifier; auto-generated at creation as `Str::slug(name) . '-' . random(8)` |
| `logo_path` | string(255) | nullable | Relative path on the `public` disk; absent until the owner uploads a logo. The API resource resolves it to a public `logo_url` via `Storage::disk('public')->url(...)` |
| `phone_country_code` | varchar(5) | nullable | E.164 country prefix incl. `+` (e.g. `+39`). Pair with `phone_national_number` — both null OR both filled, enforced by `required_with` in the FormRequest (#161). Same shape as the athletes pair. Settable via `PATCH /api/v1/academy` |
| `phone_national_number` | varchar(20) | nullable | Unformatted national digits (no spaces / dashes / parentheses). Validated together with `phone_country_code` via libphonenumber. Settable via `PATCH /api/v1/academy` |
| `website` | string(255) | nullable | Public website URL (#162). Validated as a parseable URL — bare `@handles` are rejected with 422. Independently nullable from the other contact links. |
| `facebook` | string(255) | nullable | Facebook page URL (#162). Same shape as `website`. |
| `instagram` | string(255) | nullable | Instagram profile URL (#162). Same shape as `website`. |
| `monthly_fee_cents` | unsigned int | nullable | Academy-wide membership fee, **stored in cents** to avoid float pitfalls (€95.00 = `9500`). `null` means "fee not configured" — the payments endpoints reject `POST` with 422 until the owner sets it. Settable via `PATCH /api/v1/academy` |
| `training_days` | json (list&lt;int&gt;) | nullable | Weekdays the academy trains on, Carbon `dayOfWeek` ints (0=Sun…6=Sat). Cast to `array` on the model. `null` means "schedule not configured" — the daily check-in UI falls back to all-weekdays in that state. Settable on create + update |
| `created_at` | timestamp | nullable | |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | nullable | |

## Relations

- `belongsTo(User::class, 'user_id')` — exposed as the `owner()` method
- `hasMany(Athlete::class)` — all athletes in this academy
- `morphOne(Address::class, 'addressable')` — structured address (#72), see [`address.md`](./address.md)

## Indexes

- `PRIMARY KEY(id)`
- `UNIQUE(user_id)` — enforces one-academy-per-user
- `UNIQUE(slug)` — enforces URL uniqueness

## Business rules

- **Creation is one-shot.** `POST /api/v1/academy` fails with 409 if the owner already has one — only one academy per user, ever.
- **`name`, `address`, `logo_path`, `monthly_fee_cents`, and `training_days` are mutable** via `PATCH /api/v1/academy` (and the dedicated `/academy/logo` endpoints for the logo file). `slug` is intentionally immutable — renames keep the original permalink stable.
- **Address (#72) is a separate polymorphic entity.** `addresses` lives in its own table (`addressable_type` + `addressable_id`); the academy exposes it via `morphOne`. The 1:1 invariant is NOT carried by `morphOne` alone (Eloquent's morph relation just returns the first match) — it's enforced by the UNIQUE index on `(addressable_type, addressable_id)` in the `addresses` table, plus `SyncAcademyAddressAction` going through the relation's `updateOrCreate(...)` so concurrent inserts hit the constraint instead of producing duplicates. PATCH semantics: send `address: { line1, line2, city, postal_code, province, country }` to upsert in place, `address: null` to clear (delete the row), or omit the key to leave untouched. See [`address.md`](./address.md).
- **Slug is server-generated, not user-supplied.** The shape is `slugified(name) + '-' + 8 lowercase random chars`, e.g. `gracie-barra-lisboa-a3f9kx2b`. This guarantees uniqueness without exposing collision logic to the user.
- **`monthly_fee_cents` snapshots into payment rows.** When `RecordAthletePaymentAction` records a payment, it copies the academy's *current* `monthly_fee_cents` into `athlete_payments.amount_cents`. Future fee changes therefore do NOT rewrite past payment history.
- **The SPA's `/dashboard` routes are guarded by `hasAcademyGuard`.** A logged-in user without an academy is redirected to `/setup`. A user with an academy trying to visit `/setup` is redirected to `/dashboard`.
- **Academy-scoping on every authenticated request** is handled in the controllers, not in a policy or model scope — we match the Athlete pattern. `StoreAthleteRequest::authorize()` and similar check `$user->academy !== null`; the controller then uses `$user->academy->id` to filter queries.
- **No soft-delete.** Deleting a user cascades to their academy which cascades to their athletes.

## Related endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/academy` — create (one-shot, 409 if the user already has one)
- `GET /api/v1/academy` — fetch the authenticated user's academy; returns 404 if none (SPA uses this to detect first-login state)
- `PATCH /api/v1/academy` — partial update of `name`, `address`, `monthly_fee_cents`, `training_days`
- `POST /api/v1/academy/logo` — upload/replace logo
- `DELETE /api/v1/academy/logo` — remove logo
